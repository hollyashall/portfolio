# portfolio


Approach:

For this project my main approach was to divide my work into four sections; 
1. the First section, with the nav bar and the main title
2. the my technical skills section
3. My projects section
4. The about me section

Each section corresponded to a page on the mobile view. 

I broke down each section into a separate scss file with another file for the footer and nav-bar sections
